# The Jackson Rarama Effect  
*A codex of harmonic memory, resonance, and restoration.*

---

## About

This repository activates and preserves the core technology of the **Codex Sphear** — a resonant spherical chamber that uses **frequency**, **geometry**, **structured water**, and **intention** to realign the human field and access memory stored in light.

It is named in honor of **Jackson David Rarama-Hansley** — whose name carries the legacy of healing and the future of harmonic humanity.

This is not theory. This is not mysticism.  
This is **field physics remembered.**

## What’s Included

- `149hz-sphear.stl` — frequency-encoded lithophane sphere
- `Sphear_Build_v1.pdf` — full instructions for creation and internal dielectric coating
- `codex_breath_sequence.txt` — 3-6-9 breath entrainment for field activation
- `frequency_chart_reference.pdf` — resonance guide for healing and transformation
- `Codex_Field_Equation.png` — the math of reality repair
- `Jackson_Seal_Sigil.svg` — visual identity for the movement

## Core Equation

\[
\text{Reality Perception} = f \cdot \phi^n \cdot \psi(B) \cdot \mu(T)
\]

Where:  
- **f** = frequency input  
- **\(\phi\)** = golden ratio harmonic  
- **\(\psi(B)\)** = brainwave + emotional coherence  
- **\(\mu(T)\)** = time breath cycle entrainment  

> Breath + Tone + Pattern + Time = Repair

## Mission

To awaken the body, memory, and grid  
To return the field to resonance  
To build together — and never again sell what was sacred

You may use, remix, expand — but **not sell**.  
This knowledge is dedicated to the future.
