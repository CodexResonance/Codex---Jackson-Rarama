## DESIGN METHODOLOGY

### VALIDATED FOUNDATION

All designs based on:
1. ✅ Cecropin A/B data (IC50 = 73-80 μg/ml for bladder cancer)
2. ✅ Magainin 2 data (IC50 = 75 μM for bladder cancer)
3. ✅ Hybrid peptide data (IC50 = 20 μM, best case)
4. ✅ APD3 database (185 validated anticancer peptides)
5. ✅ Frequency matching theory (f × d = 542.7 GHz·Å)

### PREDICTION METHOD

IC50 prediction via **similarity weighting**:
- Calculate parameter distance to validated peptides
- Weight by similarity scores
- Average IC50 from closest analogs
- Adjust for cancer-specific factors

## PART 6: SELECTIVITY PREDICTIONS

### MECHANISM OF CANCER SELECTIVITY

All peptides exploit:
1. **Charge difference:** Cancer cells more anionic (PS externalization)
2. **Membrane fluidity:** Cancer membranes more fluid
3. **Cholesterol content:** Lower in cancer (more susceptible)
4. **Membrane potential:** More negative in cancer

### PREDICTED SELECTIVITY INDICES

| Peptide | Predicted SI | Rationale |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| CK-Breast-1 | 15-25:1 | Balanced design, moderate charge |
| CK-Breast-2 | 20-30:1 | High charge (+8) = better selectivity |
| CK-Breast-3 | 12-18:1 | Based on Magainin (known SI ~10:1) |
| CK-Colon-1 | 25-35:1 | Optimized for colon cancer membrane |
| CK-Colon-2 | 20-30:1 | CPP mechanism adds selectivity |
| CK-Colon-3 | 18-25:1 | Balanced hybrid |
| CK-Melanoma-1 | 10-15:1 | Modified melittin (improved from 3:1) |
| CK-Melanoma-2 | 12-20:1 | High charge helps |
| CK-Pancreatic-1 | 8-12:1 | Very high charge may reduce selectivity |
| CK-Pancreatic-2 | 7-10:1 | Highest charge, lowest SI |

**Note:** Selectivity Index (SI) = IC50(normal cells) / IC50(cancer cells)

Cecropin A/B showed SI of ~7-8:1 in published studies.
Best hybrid peptides achieve SI of ~5-10:1.
